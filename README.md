# Binary Search Tree

A binary search tree (BST) is a data structure that stores a collection of nodes, each with a key and an optional value. A BST has the following properties:

- The key of each node is unique and can be compared using a total order relation.
- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
- The height of a BST is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf.

A BST supports efficient operations such as search, insert, delete, minimum, maximum, predecessor, successor, etc. The average time complexity of these operations is O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. However, the worst-case time complexity can be O(n) if the tree is unbalanced.
